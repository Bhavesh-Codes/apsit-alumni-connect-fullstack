```


1.  **Create Database:**
    * Log in to MySQL and create a new database:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE apsit_alumni_db;
        ```
2.  **Configure Properties:**
    * Go to `apsit-connect/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    * Update `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` to match your MySQL credentials.
3.  **Run the Backend:**
    * Open a terminal inside the `apsit-connect` folder.
    * Run the command:
        ```bash
        mvn clean spring-boot:run
        ```
    * The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (`frontend`)

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * Open a *second* terminal inside the `frontend` folder.
    * Run the command:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
2.  **Run the Frontend:**
    * In the same terminal, run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.
